# hello-world
Initial GitHub repository to learn how the process works.

Hello, my name is Imran. I want to learn how to code, how to understand code, how code runs, how it functions...I want to progress and learn as much as I can...I am unimaginably disappointed in myself for code not making any sense to me for such a long time...I want to improve.

I am going to improve.
